Title: Autosave the game

Primary Actor: The Player

Stakeholders:
    The player wants to have the option to quit the game and retain their
    progress, so that they can claim the ability to "stop whenever they like".

Precondition:
    Before saving, the player has completed any actions that would prevent a
    scene transition, e.g. closed all modal dialogs, completed combat, etc.

Postcondition:
    The state of the game is saved as of the end of the scene, to potentially
    be reloaded at some time in the future.

Main Success Scenario:
    1. The player initiates a switch between scenes.
    2. The current scene is made unavailable for interaction.
    3. The current scene and any actions taken in it are finalized.
    4. The game state is serialized and saved to disk.
    5. A notification is made to the player that the game was autosaved.
    6. The new scene loads.

Extensions/Alternative Flows:
    5. The game state is unable to be written to disk due to some error.
    6. A dialog appears informing the player that the save was unsuccessful.
    7. The player is given the option to Abort, Retry, or Fail.
        - If the player chooses Abort:
            1. The game quits unceremoniously.
            2. The player is left dazed and confused.
        - If the player chooses Retry:
            1. The game attempts to save the game state to disk again.
                - If the save is successful, continue the scene change normally.
                - If the save is unsuccessful, show the dialog again.
        - If the player chooses Fail:
            1. The game informs the player that their state has not been saved,
               and that their progress may be lost if they continue playing.
            2. The scene change continues normally.
