Ship Destruction Use Case
Ryan Burns

Title: Destroy ships

Primary Actor: The player

Stakeholders: The player wants to have options to attempt escape or attempt surrender, or the option to fight it out with the given NPC.

Precondition: The player is traveling to a planet, and is approached by either a pirate, police officer, or trader who is not friendly.

Postcondition: If attempting escape, either the player escapes NPC interaction without punishment, or is dealt a health deduction and entered into battle if caught by NPC.
               If attempting surrender, either the player successfully surrenders and pays a prorated fee to the NPC for their "loss", or is entered into battle normally.
               If attempting to fight the NPC, the animation for fighting will open, and the player will have a chance to kill the enemy ship or be destroyed.

Main Success Scenario: 1. Player is approached by NPC, initiating interaction.
                       2. Player chooses from escape, surrender, or fight.
                       3. Proper odds are applied, and either interaction is ended appropriately, or battle begins.
                       4. Player fights with NPC via battle interface.
                       5. One of the two ships is destroyed in battle.

Extensions/Alternative Flows: 1. Player attempts to save and exit game mid-battle/interaction.
                                    - Process save game.
                                    - Re-enter battle at starting position with correct healths, essentially restart battle when game is loaded.
                              2. Player hard-closes game mid-battle/interaction (or shuts down computer, etc.).
                                    - Upon loading, if battle was not terminated properly, will revert back to last save.
                                    - Punishment will be half of current wealth taken from you for tampering.
